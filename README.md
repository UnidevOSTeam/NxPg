#NxPg
----

This README file is a placeholder.  NxPg itself isn't ready yet.

NxPg is a lightweight Content Management System (CMS) for websites with modest needs.  
It isn't as capable as a heavyweight CMS like WordPress. It also isn't as complicated.

As currently envisioned, NxPg requires some technical knowledge to
first set up a site -- such as PHP, HTML, and MySQL.  After that,
someone with little technical background can maintain the contents.

----
##The backstory:

Several years ago, we at [Unidev][1] developed a website for a local manufacturer.  
The delivered product included administrative tools for the client to maintain the 
site after the initial setup.  That site is still up, and the client is still happy 
with it.

Since we retained the copyrights to the code delivered to the client, we 
can open the source and let others adapt it to their needs.

----
##The problem:

The client's data is not completely separated from the administrative code.
The PHP contains hard-coded references to the client's business.

Before we can publish NxPg, we have to scrub the client-specific stuff
from the code, and replace it with fictitious data about a fictitious
company.

We'll also clean up things along the way -- sloppy code if we notice it,
or various bits and scraps of unnecessary junk.  We'll also add copyright
notices (NxPg will be licensed under the GNU General Public License,
version 3).

We'll also have to become familiar with the GitHub tools for on-line
collaboration.  We'll make mistakes, and probably embarrass ourselves
from time to time, but that's life in the open source fishbowl.

All of this will take time, and we're just getting started.  If you're
looking for a lightweight CMS (and you don't need it right away),
check back later.  Watch NxPg take shape.  Join us.
